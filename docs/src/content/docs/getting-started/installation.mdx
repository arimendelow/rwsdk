description: Get started with Redwood SDK by installing the framework and creating your first application.

import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<Aside type="note" title="Prerequisites">
- Redwood requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) (v22.x or later)
- [Cloudflare Account](https://www.cloudflare.com/)
</Aside>

This is the easiest way to install the RedwoodSDK package. However, we've created a few [starter kits](/reference/starters/minimal) that are pre-configured for different use cases and make this process even easier.

{/* TODO: This will need to be updated - We'll be using Vite Community Templates: https://vite.dev/guide/#community-templates */}
```bash frame="none"
npx create-redwood@latest
```

Move into that directory, install the dependencies, and start the development server:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="pnpm">
    ```bash frame="none"
    cd my-app
    pnpm install
    pnpm dev
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="npm">
    ```bash frame="none"
    cd my-app
    npm install
    npm run dev
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="yarn">
    ```bash frame="none"
    cd my-app
    yarn install
    yarn dev
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Now, you can open your browser to http://localhost:1234 where you'll see the Welcome Page:

## Troubleshooting

### Node.js Installation
If you're having trouble with Node.js installation:
1. We recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) for managing Node versions
2. For setup help, see the [nvm installation guide](#)
3. Most common issues are resolved by:
    - Using the recommended nvm commands
    - Restarting your terminal after installation
