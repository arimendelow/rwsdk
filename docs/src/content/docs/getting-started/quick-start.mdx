In this quick start you'll go from zero to request/ response in seconds, and deploy to production in minutes.

To install a minimal project, run the following command, replace `<project-name>` with your own project's name.

```bash frame="none"
npx degit redwoodjs/sdk/starters/minimal#main <project-name>
```

<Aside type="note" title="Starter Templates">
RedwoodSDK provides a number of starter templates to help you get started.

- [Prisma](https://github.com/redwoodjs/sdk/tree/main/starters/prisma): Database access with Prisma and Cloudflare D1
- [Prisma & Authentication](https://github.com/redwoodjs/sdk/tree/main/starters/passkey-auth): Database access & Passkey authentication

The terminal will display a message that Vite development server is ready to accept requests.

```bash frame="none"
VITE v6.2.0  ready in 500 ms

➜  Local:   http://localhost:2332/
➜  Network: use --host to expose
➜  press h + enter to show help
```

Access the development server in your browser, by default it's available at [http://localhost:2332](http://localhost:2332),
and you should see "Hello World" displayed on the page.

How exciting, your first request/response in Redwood SDK!

## Start developing

RedwoodSDK is based on Cloudflare, so the entry point of your website is `src/worker.tsx`, open that file in your favorite editor.

Here you'll see the `defineApp` function, this is the main function that "defines your website," where the purpose is to accept requests and return responses to the client.

```tsx title="src/worker.tsx" collapse={1-5} "defineApp"
import { defineApp } from "redwoodsdk/worker";
import { index, layout } from "redwoodsdk/router";
import { Document } from "src/Document";
import { Home } from "src/pages/Home";

export default defineApp([layout(Document, [index(Home)])]);
```

<Aside type="note" title="Layout & Page Components">
- `Document` is the layout component, it's the parent component of your website, it's responsible for providing the basic structure of your website, such as the header, footer, and sidebar.

- `Home` is a page component of your website, it's the component that will be rendered when the user navigates to the root URL of your website.

</Aside>

Open `src/app/pages/Home.tsx`:

```tsx title="src/app/pages/Home.tsx"
export function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello World</h1>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Modify the `Home` component to say "My Personal Website" instead of "Hello World". When you save the file, the development server will automatically reload the component.

```tsx title="src/app/pages/Home.tsx" del="<h1>Hello World</h1>" ins="<h1>My Personal Website</h1>"
export function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello World</h1>
      <h1>My Personal Website</h1>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Deploy to production

RedwoodSDK is optimized for the Cloudflare Development Platform, and you can deploy your website to Cloudflare with a single command, but first you need to change the `wrangler.jsonc` file; and modify the `name` field to your own project's name.

```jsonc title="wrangler.jsonc" del="__change_me__"
{
  // Schema reference
  "$schema": "./node_modules/wrangler/config-schema.json",
  "name": "__change_me__",
  "main": "src/worker.tsx",
  "compatibility_date": "2024-09-23",
  "compatibility_flags": ["nodejs_compat"],
  "assets": {
    "binding": "ASSETS",
  },
  "observability": {
    "enabled": true,
  },
}
```

Then run the following command to deploy your website to Cloudflare.

```

```
