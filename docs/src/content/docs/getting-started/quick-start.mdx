To install a standard project, run the following command, replace `<project-name>` with your own project's name.

```bash frame="none"
npx degit redwoodjs/sdk/starters/standard#main <project-name>
```

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="pnpm">
    ```bash frame="none"
    cd <project-name>
    pnpm install
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="npm">
    ```bash frame="none"
    cd <project-name>
    npm install
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="yarn">
    ```bash frame="none"
    cd <project-name>
    yarn install
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Start developing

### Run the Vite development server

Run the vite development server, `pnpm dev`, `npm run dev`, or `yarn dev`, and the terminal will display a message that Vite development server is ready to accept requests.

```bash frame="none"
pnpm dev
VITE v6.2.0  ready in 500 ms

➜  Local:   http://localhost:2332/
➜  Network: use --host to expose
➜  press h + enter to show help
```

Access the development server in your browser, by default it's available at [http://localhost:2332](http://localhost:2332),
and you should see "Hello World" displayed on the page.

How exciting, your first request/response in RedwoodSDK!

### Your first route

The entry point of your website is `src/worker.tsx`, open that file in your favorite editor.

Here you'll see the `defineApp` function, this is the main function that "defines your website," where the purpose is to handle requests by returning responses to the client.

<Code language="jsx" title="src/worker.tsx" code={importedCodeStandardWorker} collapse={"3-17, 19-32, 35-46"} mark={[34]} />

<Aside type="note" title="Layout & Page Components">
- `Document` is the layout component, it's the parent component of your website, it's responsible for providing the basic structure of your website, such as the header, footer, and sidebar.

- `Home` is a page component of your website, it's the component that will be rendered when the user navigates to the root URL of your website.

</Aside>

Open `src/app/pages/Home.tsx`:

```tsx title="src/app/pages/Home.tsx"
export function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello World</h1>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Modify the `Home` component to say "My Personal Website" instead of "Hello World". When you save the file, the development server will automatically reload the component.

```tsx title="src/app/pages/Home.tsx" del="<h1>Hello World</h1>" ins="<h1>My Personal Website</h1>"
export function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello World</h1>
      <h1>My Personal Website</h1>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Deploy to production

RedwoodSDK is optimized for the Cloudflare Development Platform, and you can deploy your website to Cloudflare with a single command, but first you need to change the `wrangler.jsonc` file; and modify the `name` field to your own project's name.

```jsonc title="wrangler.jsonc" del="__change_me__"
{
  // Schema reference
  "$schema": "./node_modules/wrangler/config-schema.json",
  "name": "__change_me__",
  "main": "src/worker.tsx",
  "compatibility_date": "2024-09-23",
  "compatibility_flags": ["nodejs_compat"],
  "assets": {
    "binding": "ASSETS",
  },
  "observability": {
    "enabled": true,
  },
}
```

Then run the following command to deploy your website to Cloudflare.

```

```
