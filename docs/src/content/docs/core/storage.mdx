description: Upload & download files to Cloudflare R2.
---

RedwoodSDK is built to work on the Cloudflare Developer Platform. R2 is Cloudflare's object storage solution that's similar to AWS S3.

## Setup

To use R2 in your project, you need to create a R2 bucket, and bind it to your worker.

```bash
npx wrangler r2 bucket create my-bucket

Creating bucket 'my-bucket'...
âœ… Created bucket 'my-bucket' with default storage class of Standard.

Configure your Worker to write objects to this bucket:

[[r2_buckets]]
bucket_name = "my-bucket"
binding = "R2"
```

This will create a bucket called `my-bucket`, which you'll have to bind to your worker.

```jsonc title="wrangler.jsonc"
{
  "r2_buckets": [
    {
      "bucket_name": "my-bucket",
      "binding": "R2",
    },
  ],
}
```

This will make the `my-bucket` object available via the `env` variable `R2`.

## Usage

Since RedwoodSDK is built on standard Request/ Response objects you can stream files directly to R2.

### Uploading Files

```tsx title="src/worker.tsx"
import { defineApp } from "redwoodsdk/worker";
import { route } from "redwoodsdk/router";

defineApp([
  route("/upload/", async ({ request, env }) => {
    const formData = await request.formData();
    const file = formData.get("file") as File;

    // Stream the file directly to R2
    const r2ObjectKey = `/storage/${file.name}`;
    await env.R2.put(r2ObjectKey, file.stream(), {
      httpMetadata: {
        contentType: file.type,
      },
    });

    return new Response(JSON.stringify({ key: r2ObjectKey }), {
      status: 200,
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
      },
    });
  }),
]);
```

### Downloading Files

```tsx title="src/worker.tsx"
import { defineApp } from "redwoodsdk/worker";
import { route } from "redwoodsdk/router";

defineApp([
  route("/download/*", async ({ request, params, env }) => {
    const object = await env.R2.get("/storage/" + params.$0);
    if (object === null) {
      return new Response("Object Not Found", { status: 404 });
    }
    return new Response(object.body, {
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": object.httpMetadata?.contentType as string,
      },
    });
  }),
]);
```
