## üîê Security Headers in the Standard Starter

The standard starter includes a set of security headers by default in [`app/headers.ts`](https://github.com/redwoodjs/sdk/blob/main/starters/standard/src/app/headers.ts). These help protect against common attacks like cross-site scripting (XSS), clickjacking, and data injection.

### Changing CSP headers

#### Using `nonce` for inline scripts

### Lifting device permission restrictions

Sometimes you need to allow your web application to access device features like the camera, microphone, or geolocation. These permissions are controlled by the `Permissions-Policy` header.

By default, the standard starter includes restrictive permissions settings for security reasons.

To enable device access, you'll need to modify the `Permissions-Policy` header in your [`app/headers.ts`](https://github.com/redwoodjs/sdk/blob/main/starters/standard/src/) file:

```diff
// In app/headers.ts
headers.set(
  "Permissions-Policy",
-  "geolocation=(), microphone=(), camera=()",
+  "geolocation=self, microphone=self, camera=self"
);
```

The `self` keyword allows the feature to be used only by your own domain.
