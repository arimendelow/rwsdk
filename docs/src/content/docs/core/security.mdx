## üîê Security Headers

The standard starter includes a set of security headers by default in [`app/headers.ts`](https://github.com/redwoodjs/sdk/blob/main/starters/standard/src/app/headers.ts). These help protect against common attacks like cross-site scripting (XSS), clickjacking, and data injection.

### Changing CSP (Content Security Policy) headers

Sometimes you need to allow additional resources or modify the Content Security Policy (CSP) to accommodate third-party scripts, styles, or other assets. The CSP headers control what resources can be loaded and executed by your application.

#### Adding trusted domains

The default CSP in the starter focuses on the most critical security aspects. For many applications, this provides a good balance between security and functionality. When you need to integrate third-party resources, you can extend it like this:

<Aside>
  Your CSP should reflect your application's needs. Some apps require more
  permissive policies to function properly, while security-critical applications
  might need stricter controls. The key is understanding the tradeoffs and
  making informed decisions. For more information, see the [MDN Content Security
  Policy documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP).
</Aside>

```diff
// In app/headers.ts
headers.set(
  "Content-Security-Policy",
- `default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'nonce-${nonce}' https://challenges.cloudflare.com; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; frame-src https://challenges.cloudflare.com; object-src 'none';`,
+ `default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'nonce-${nonce}' https://challenges.cloudflare.com https://trusted-scripts.example.com; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; frame-src https://challenges.cloudflare.com; img-src 'self' https://images.example.com; object-src 'none';`,
);
```

#### Using `nonce` for inline scripts

Sometimes you need to include inline scripts in your application, but Content Security Policy (CSP) blocks them by default for security reasons. RedwoodSDK automatically generates a fresh, cryptographically secure nonce value for each request You can access this nonce in document or page components rendered by the [router](./routing), using `rw.nonce`.

<Aside type="caution">
  Only use the nonce attribute for trusted inline scripts that you have full
  control over. Adding nonces to third-party or user-generated scripts defeats
  the purpose of CSP protection and could expose your application to cross-site
  scripting (XSS) attacks.
</Aside>

```tsx
export const Document = ({ rw, children }) => (
  <html lang="en">
    <head><!-- ... --></head>
    <body>
      <div id="root">{children}</div>

      <!-- Set the nonce the inline script -->
      <script nonce={row.nonce}>/* ... */</script>
    </body>
  </html>
);

export default defineApp([
  // ...
  render(Document, [
    // ...
  ]),
]);
```

### Lifting device permission restrictions

Sometimes you need to allow your web application to access device features like the camera, microphone, or geolocation. These permissions are controlled by the `Permissions-Policy` header.

By default, the standard starter includes restrictive permissions settings for security reasons.

To enable device access, you'll need to modify the `Permissions-Policy` header in your [`app/headers.ts`](https://github.com/redwoodjs/sdk/blob/main/starters/standard/src/) file:

```diff
// In app/headers.ts
headers.set(
  "Permissions-Policy",
-  "geolocation=(), microphone=(), camera=()",
+  "geolocation=self, microphone=self, camera=self"
);
```

The `self` keyword allows the feature to be used only by your own domain.
