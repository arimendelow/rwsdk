title: What is RedwoodSDK?
description: From concept to cloud

import { Card, CardGrid } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';


RedwoodSDK gives you a complete set of composable tools to handle the request/response lifecycle of webapps.

At its core, **it's just a Vite plugin** that seamlessly enables **SSR**, **React Server Components**, **React Server Functions**, and **real-time**.

It's also a **standards-compliant** HTTP server with middleware, route handling, and interruptorsâ€”giving you full control over every request.

All of it runs on the **Cloudflare Development Platform**, with seamless access to compute (Workers/ Durable Objects), database (D1), storage (R2), queues, and AI.
Thanks to Cloudflare's Miniflare Simulator, you don't need to install any additional services locally. Development matches production!

## Design Philosophy



We believe that the best way to build webapps is to be standards-compliant, to adhere to the request/response paradigm, and to be transparent and composable.

### Standards compliant

We've removed the pain of abstracting away the underlying platform, and instead embraced it. The browser is the primary focus, with the request/response cycle as the foundation.

### Request/Response

The `Request` and `Response` objects are the foundation of the request/response paradigm. 
By focusing on these objects, you'll able to seamlessly integrate with the web, streaming responses to the browser, and even build real-time applications.

### Transparent and composable

You are able to follow the flow from request to response, and to understand, and mofify, how each step is handled.

- No hidden files
- No magic imports / exports
- No generated types
