For the log out functionality, let's start by going back to our `worker.tsx` file. Within our `render` function, let's add a new route for the `/logout` route. We can do everything within our route function. We don't even need to create a page component.

```tsx title="src/worker.tsx" startLineNumber={74} {"1. Create new headers": 2} {"2. Remove the session": 4} {"3. Redirect the user to the home page": 6}
route("/logout", async function ({ request }) {

  const headers = new Headers();

  await sessions.remove(request, headers);

  headers.set("Location", "/");
  return new Response(null, {
    status: 302,
    headers,
  });
}),
```

If you app is still running (`pnpm dev`), head over to `localhost:5173/logout` and you should be logged out and redirected to the home page. Now, if you try to revisit the `/protected` page, you should be redirected to the `/login` page.
