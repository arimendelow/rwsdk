import { Aside, FileTree } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

Let's start by setting up the registration page. inside the `pages` directory, create a new folder called `auth` and inside create a new file called `RegisterPage.tsx`.

<FileTree>
- src/
  - app/
    - pages/
      - auth/
        - RegisterPage.tsx
</FileTree>

Inside the `RegisterPage.tsx` file, add the following code:

```tsx title="src/app/pages/auth/RegisterPage.tsx"
const RegisterPage = () => {
  return (
    <form>
      <h1>Register</h1>
      <div>
        <label htmlFor="username">Username</label>
        <input type="text" name="username" placeholder="Username" />
      </div>
      <div>
        <label htmlFor="email">Email</label>
        <input type="email" name="email" placeholder="Email" />
      </div>
      <div>
        <label htmlFor="password">Password</label>
        <input type="password" name="password" placeholder="Password" />
      </div>
      <button type="submit">Login</button>
    </form>
  )
}
```

No styles. We'll keep this as simple as possible. We have a standard HTML form with 3 inputs and a submit button.

## Registration Flow

Here are the steps for our registration flow:

- User submits a registration form with a email, username, and password (and any other required information)
- Server validates the submission
- Server checks if the username or email address already exist in the database
- If validation passes, server:
  - generates a salt for the password
  - hashes the password with the salt
  - stores the user information and hashed password in the database
- Optional: send a verification email ([we'll come back to this](/guides/auth/username-password/email))
- Return a success (or error) response to the client


## Connecting the Form

Within RedwoodSDK, all components are server components by default. Then, you need to specify a client component by adding a `"use client"` directive at the top of the file.

Normally, I like to leave page components as server components, but for this example, we'll make the `RegisterPage` a client component so that we can keep track of the form state.

```tsx title="src/app/pages/auth/RegisterPage.tsx"
"use client"
```

On our `form` tag, let's add an `action` attribute and pass it the `handleSubmit` function.
