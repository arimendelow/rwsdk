## Overview

The flow for One Time Password (OTP) is very similar to the [Magic Link](/guides/auth/magic-links/overview) flow, with a couple of key differences.

With the Magic Link flow, each user is getting a unique link with a token to click on.

## Setup

Our [standard starter](https://github.com/redwoodjs/sdk/tree/main/starters/standard) includes Passkeys out of the box. This provides a passwordless experience, eliminating a lot of the risks associated with password-based authentication. However, there still might be instances where you don't want to use Passkeys, but still want to avoid the hassle of passwords.

<Aside type="tip" title="Standard Starter">
You can find the final code for this guide in the [auth-kitchen/magic-links folder](https://github.com/ahaywood/auth-kitchen/tree/main/magic-links) branch.
</Aside>

Let’s start with the standard starter and make adjustments. Within the Terminal, we’ll create a new project and install the dependencies.

```bash
npx degit redwoodjs/sdk/starters/standard <project-name>
cd <project-name>
pnpm install
```

Let's start by removing the `src/app/pages/users` directory. This contains all the routes for our passkey authentication.

Then, within our `src/worker.tsx` file, we can remove the user routes:

```diff title="src/worker.tsx" showLineNumbers=false
- import { userRoutes } from "@/app/pages/user/routes";
...
- prefix("/user", userRoutes),
```

You may have noticed, we're keeping our session Durable Object. We can repurpose this.

<Aside type="note" title="Session Durable Object">
The session durable object is stored within the `src/session` directory. There, you'll find two files: `durableObject.ts` and `store.ts`.

The `durableObject.ts` file sets up the Durable Object. The `store.ts` file contains helper functions for interacting with the Durable Object: `createSessionStore` and `setupSessionStore`.
