# Calldrop -- Record. Drop. Replay.

Calldrop automatically stores and shares Zoom meeting's recordings. Once a meeting is concluded, and the recording is available, Zoom sends a webhook to Calldrop which uploads the video and emails the participants.

## Getting started

```terminal
pnpm install
pnpm migrate:dev
pnpm dev
```
